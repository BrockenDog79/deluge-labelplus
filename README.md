Label Plus
==========

Label Plus is a plugin for [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org) that
can be used to organize torrents by assigning labels to them. It was
based on Label 0.2 by Martijn Voncken, but adds more functionality.

This is mainly a GtkUI plugin. It adds a status column, a torrent
submenu, and a sidebar tree. WebUI support is minimal with only a
status column added.

Features
--------
- Sublabels
- Less restrictive label names
- Ability to rename labels
- Relative move completed paths
- Autolabeling based on torrent name or tracker
